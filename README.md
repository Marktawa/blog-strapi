# Blog using Next.js and Strapi

> **NOTE:**
> 
> *This project is based on the [Strapi Starter Next 13, Tailwind, Typescript, and Strapi]() made by [Trecia](https://github.com/TreciaKS), [Daniel](https://github.com/malgamves) and [Paul](https://github.com/PaulBratslavsky) from the Strapi Team.*

## Introduction

This project is a code repo for the Strapi blog article [Build a blog with Next.js and Strapi]().

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marktawa/blog-strapi
```

2. Set up backend dependencies:

```bash
cd blog-strapi
cd backend
yarn
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Start your project by running the following command:

```bash
  yarn build
  yarn develop
```

Create your first admin user.

## Seeding the Data

At the root of our project, we have our `seed-schema.tar` file. We will use it to update the schema for our Strapi app.

1. Go back to your terminal and stop your Strapi backend server by pressing `CTRL` plus `C` on your keyboard.
   
2. Run the following command in the root of your project folder `blog-strapi` to update the schema:

```bash
tar xvf seed-schema.tar -C backend
```
3. Import data into your backend's database:

```bash
cd backend
yarn strapi import -f ../seed-data.tar.gz
```

Answer `y` to `The import will delete all assets and data in your database. Are you sure you want to proceed? (y/N)`

4. After a successful import, rerun your Strapi backend server. 

```bash
yarn develop
```

In your browser, log in to your admin panel. You should see the newly imported `content` and `collection types`.

## Frontend Setup

1. Open up a new terminal session and navigate into your `frontend` folder. Set up frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
yarn
```
2. Create `.env` file:

```bash
touch .env
```

3. Paste in the following. 

```yaml
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAGE_LIMIT=6
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1337
```
4. Before starting our Next JS app we need to go inside our Strapi Admin and create a token that we will be using for displaying our **content**.

Inside your Strapi Admin Panel navigate to `Settings` -> `API Tokens` and click on the `Create new API Token`.

![api-tokens](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6153188/231865572-cebc5538-374c-4050-91cd-c303fae25a3d.png)

Here are our Token Settings

Name: Public API Token Content
Description: Access to public content.
Token duration: Unlimited
Token type: Custom

In Permissions let's give the following access.

| Content         |   Permissions    |
| --------------- | :--------------: |
| Article         | find and findOne |
| Author          | find and findOne |
| Category        | find and findOne |
| Global          |       find       |
| Page            | find and findOne |
| Product-feature | find and findOne |

Once you have your token add it to your `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_API_TOKEN` variable name in the `.env` file.

5. Start your frontend

```bash
yarn dev
```
